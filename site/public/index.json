I tore down my old K3s cluster and I\u0026rsquo;m planning to rebuild it with Talos. The cycle of building, breaking, and rebuilding is half the fun.\nCooking is how I decompress. I\u0026rsquo;m not a chef by any stretch, but I enjoy the process - experimenting with recipes, failing spectacularly, and occasionally making something worth eating. Currently on a quest to make the perfect breakfast tacos. I\u0026rsquo;ve also gotten into baking bread, which is mostly an excuse to eat warm bread with too much butter.\nCars and motorcycles - I\u0026rsquo;ve owned around 20 cars over the years. I have a thing for DSMs (90s Eclipse, Talon) and have owned several, though I\u0026rsquo;ve never managed to get one running right. The eternal project car. On two wheels, I have a 2017 Yamaha XSR900 that I take out whenever the weather cooperates.\nTravel when I can. I like seeing new places, eating food I can\u0026rsquo;t pronounce, and getting lost in cities I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nGaming casually these days. I raided in WoW from 2007-2014, but now it\u0026rsquo;s mostly Dyson Sphere Program, Overwatch, and Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate 3 when I have time.\nThe Day Job #I work in tech - specifically in the product/platform space. I\u0026rsquo;ve spent years in SRE, DevOps, and now product management. It pays the bills and I genuinely enjoy it, but it\u0026rsquo;s not my whole personality. You can check out my CV if you\u0026rsquo;re curious about the professional stuff.\nThis Site #This is where I write about whatever\u0026rsquo;s on my mind. Tech stuff, homelab projects, things I\u0026rsquo;m learning, random thoughts. No schedule, no monetization.\nBuilt with Hugo and the Congo theme.\n","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about/","section":"Brandon Cantrell","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHey, I\u0026rsquo;m Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-im-into\" class=\"relative group\"\u003eWhat I\u0026rsquo;m Into \u003cspan class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#what-im-into\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHomelabbing\u003c/strong\u003e is probably my biggest time sink right now.
