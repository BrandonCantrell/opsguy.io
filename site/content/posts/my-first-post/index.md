Welcome. After thinking about it for way too long, I've finally decided to start writing publicly about things I find interesting.

## Why Start a Blog?

I've always found that writing helps me think more clearly. Whether I'm learning something new, building a project, or just trying to work through an idea, putting words on a page forces me to organize my thoughts.

This isn't a professional blog or a carefully curated portfolio. It's just me writing about whatever I feel like - homelabs, cooking experiments, music, random tech things I'm learning.

## What to Expect

Probably a lot of posts about:
- **Homelab stuff** - K8s, self-hosting, infrastructure tinkering
- **Food** - recipes I'm trying, restaurants I like
- **Tech** - things I'm learning or building
- **Random thoughts** - whatever else is on my mind

No schedule. Just words on the internet.
