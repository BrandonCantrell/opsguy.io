## Summary

I'm a Technical Product Manager who came up through the engineering ranks - SRE, DevOps, Linux admin. I like digging into complex problems and figuring out how to make things work better. When someone says "it can't be done" or "it's too complicated," that's usually when I get interested.

Currently driving platform engineering and reliability strategy at PENN Entertainment, where I've spent the last few years helping build the infrastructure behind ESPNBet.
