Hey, I'm Brandon.

## What I'm Into

**Homelabbing** is probably my biggest time sink right now. I tore down my old K3s cluster and I'm planning to rebuild it with Talos. The cycle of building, breaking, and rebuilding is half the fun.

**Tinkering** in general. 3D printing, small electronics, whatever catches my interest. My hobby is hobbies.

**Cooking** is how I decompress. I cook all the meals for my partner, which means I'm in the kitchen a lot. I love making Chinese food, grilling, and smoking meat. I've also gotten into baking bread, which is mostly an excuse to eat warm bread with too much butter.

**Food** in general. I'm a foodie, but a weird one. I don't care about fancy restaurants. Give me a hole in the wall place where you're not entirely sure you won't get food poisoning, and I'm happy. Good food doesn't have to be expensive.

**Cars and motorcycles** - I've owned around 20 cars over the years. I love Japanese and German cars, not much of a truck guy. On two wheels, I have a 2017 Yamaha XSR900 that I take out whenever the weather cooperates.

**Travel** when I can. I'm the type to make minimal plans and just explore as I go. Mountains over beaches, and I love big cities and cityscapes. Japan is at the top of my bucket list, along with Greece, Italy, Spain, Ireland, and old Europe in general. Not a fan of overly hot and humid places.

**Gaming** casually these days. I raided in WoW from 2007-2014, but now it's mostly Dyson Sphere Program, Overwatch, and Baldur's Gate 3 when I have time.

## The Day Job

I'm a Technical Program Manager who came up through the engineering ranks: help desk, Linux admin, SRE, DevOps. These days I focus on execution, keeping teams unblocked and making complex programs actually work. I still stay hands-on with the technical side because it helps me understand what the teams need. You can check out my [background](/background) if you're curious about the full story.

## This Site

This is where I write about whatever's on my mind. Tech stuff, homelab projects, things I'm learning, random thoughts. No schedule, no monetization.
