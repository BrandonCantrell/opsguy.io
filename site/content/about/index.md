Hey, I'm Brandon.

## What I'm Into

**Homelabbing** is probably my biggest time sink right now. I tore down my old K3s cluster and I'm planning to rebuild it with Talos. The cycle of building, breaking, and rebuilding is half the fun.

**Cooking** is how I decompress. I'm not a chef by any stretch, but I enjoy the process - experimenting with recipes, failing spectacularly, and occasionally making something worth eating. Currently on a quest to make the perfect breakfast tacos. I've also gotten into baking bread, which is mostly an excuse to eat warm bread with too much butter.

**Cars and motorcycles** - I've owned around 20 cars over the years. I have a thing for DSMs (90s Eclipse, Talon) and have owned several, though I've never managed to get one running right. The eternal project car. On two wheels, I have a 2017 Yamaha XSR900 that I take out whenever the weather cooperates.

**Travel** when I can. I like seeing new places, eating food I can't pronounce, and getting lost in cities I don't know.

**Gaming** casually these days. I raided in WoW from 2007-2014, but now it's mostly Dyson Sphere Program, Overwatch, and Baldur's Gate 3 when I have time.

## The Day Job

I work in tech - specifically in the product/platform space. I've spent years in SRE, DevOps, and now product management. It pays the bills and I genuinely enjoy it, but it's not my whole personality. You can check out my [CV](/cv) if you're curious about the professional stuff.

## This Site

This is where I write about whatever's on my mind. Tech stuff, homelab projects, things I'm learning, random thoughts. No schedule, no monetization.
